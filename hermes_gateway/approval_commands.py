        The agent thread(s) are blocked inside tools/approval.py waiting for
        the user to respond.  This handler signals the event so the agent
        resumes and the terminal_tool executes the command inline — the same
        flow as the CLI's synchronous input() approval.

        Supports multiple concurrent approvals (parallel subagents,
        execute_code).  ``/approve`` resolves the oldest pending command;
        ``/approve all`` resolves every pending command at once.

        Usage:
            /approve              — approve oldest pending command once
            /approve all          — approve ALL pending commands at once
            /approve session      — approve oldest + remember for session
            /approve all session  — approve all + remember for session
