        """Poll ``kanban_notify_subs`` and deliver terminal events to users.

        For each subscription row, fetches ``task_events`` newer than the
        stored cursor with kind in the terminal set (``completed``,
        ``blocked``, ``gave_up``, ``crashed``, ``timed_out``). Sends one
        message per new event to ``(platform, chat_id, thread_id)``,
        then advances the cursor. When a task reaches a terminal state
        (``completed`` / ``archived``), the subscription is removed.

        Runs in the gateway event loop; all SQLite work is pushed to a
        thread via ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the loop never blocks on the
        WAL lock. Failures in one tick don't stop subsequent ticks.

        **Multi-board:** iterates every board discovered on disk per
        tick. Subscriptions live inside each board's own DB and cannot
        cross boards, so delivery semantics are unchanged — this is
        purely a fan-out of the single-DB poll.
